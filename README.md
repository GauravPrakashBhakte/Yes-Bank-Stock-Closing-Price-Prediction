# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction
Perform regression analysis using multiple models to predict the closing price of the stock and compare the evaluation metrics for all of them to find the best model.

The Yes Bank Data is first extracted and then categorized to identify , analyze
behavior data and patterns.Using this dataset in our Supervised ML-Regression
project we found some relevant analysis which would help to predict the monthly
stock’s closing price of Yes Bank to perform better.

 Data set - data_YesBank_StockPrices - contains observations
regarding open, close, high and low prices of the yes bank stock
from July 2005 – November 2020.
 Rows: 185
 Column : 5
 Date : It denotes the month and year for a particular price.
 Open : Open means the price at which a stock started trading
that month.
 High : refers to the maximum price that month.
 Low : refers to the minimum price that month.
 Close : refers to the final trading price for that month, which we
have to predict using regression technique.

The objective of this project is to predict the stock’s closing price of the month.
Discussion of Yes Bank Dataset will involve various steps such as:

 Loading the data into data frame
 Cleaning the data
 Extracting statistics from the dataset
 Exploratory analysis and visualizations
 Train Test Split
 Linear Regression
 Lasso Regression
 Ridge Regression
 XGBoost Regression
 Conclusion

That's how we have accomplished our team work in Yes Bank stock Closing Price
Distribution Project.Throughout the project we learn many new things right from taking
problem statement to understand the technical side of a product to analysis. We deal
with Yes Bank Data as ‘Open’,’High’,’Low’,’Close’.
